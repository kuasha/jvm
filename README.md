## History
This was part of a senior year undergraduate project when the author was studying in Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh.

In 2021, the author made some changes to include the invokedynamic instruction execution capability, but coding style and other issues were not fixed as of this writing. Please do not judge the code in light of modern c++ as well, it was written by an undergrad student before C++11 existed. Love!
